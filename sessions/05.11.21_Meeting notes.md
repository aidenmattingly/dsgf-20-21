# Meeting notes for 5-11-21
## Meeting about the Graduate Group Symposium charter

# Review of what is being asked:
- A stable web repository for the Grad Group Symposium website needs to be built. This will live on the BMC LITS repository.
  - Two purposes:
    1) Provide a platform for student-designed symposium websites to live beyond the life-cycle of a student Domain of One's Own Account (i.e. stability and preservation)
    2) Provide a blueprint and rubric for future symposium websites.
- Undertake a migration of prior student-designed Grad Symposium websites located at:
        https://www.brynmawr.edu/ggacha/biennial-symposia
- Technical requirements need to be reviewed (ZS can do this)
- Communcations platforms: Slack, email, bi-weekly meetings (more as situations arise)

# Actionable items:
  - Contact Camilla McKay and Alice McGrath to set up a group meeting about the repository and migration (No later than May 12)
  - Contact Grad Symposium Committee to discuss website build and the repository (TBD after meeting with above)
  - Develop a timeline for all actions, including a final draft of the charter.
  - Domain of One's Own for Grad Symposium.
  - Charter needs to include accessibility-focused items. This might require a meeting with Communications to make sure websites are compliant since the platform is ultimately hosted by BMC.
  - Tasks need to be defined, but this needs to be done after there is a clearer picture of what migration and charter build looks like. It might be that there is a "migration team" and a "web-building / grad symposium website requirements + accessibility team".
