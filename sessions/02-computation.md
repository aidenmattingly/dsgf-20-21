### Updates

How to add your individual updates:
- Navigate to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/digbmc/dsgf-20-21) for this site and then to the **logs** folder
- Download the file **sample.md** (click **Raw** and then save it as)
- Open it up in your Atom text editor and save the file as **name.md** (your first name)
- Edit the file to add your name and a few updates for this week
- Pay attention to the syntax highlighting and follow the example when you add content
- When you're done, return to the GitHub repository. Use the branch dropdown (labeled **master**) and create a new branch. Name it something short (your initials or first name). This is your personal version of the repository.
- In the **logs** folder, select **Add file** and **Upload files**
- Write a brief comment to summarize your change (i.e. 'updates for 10/19') and select **comit changes**
- Your updates will only be visible on your personal branch.

How to publish meeting notes:
- Navigate to the GitHub page and make sure you switch to the **master** branch.
- Download the markdown file for today's session.
- Use Markdown syntax to add your own notes. Save the document.
- Return to GitHub and add the file in the same place while you're on your personal branch
- Navigate to **Pull requests** and click **new pull request**
- Select master as your base branch and your personal branch as your compare branch
- Select **Create pull request** and write a brief summary of the changes (i.e. 'notes from 10/19 session')
