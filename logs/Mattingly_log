Fall 2023 log

## November 19

What I did:
- downloaded Anaconda
- began watching code.org videos
- found code.org videos to be mostly review of what I already know

Questions/ideas:
- a lot of stuff on the DGSF page randomly seems to redirect to dead pages, is that GitHub being weird or has stuff been deleted?
- I think there needs to be better communication about weekly/biweekly expectations, and I need to take better notes during meetings.

Other updates:
- having an old wrist injury flare up, making it hard to type a lot
