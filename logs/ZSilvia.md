# My Name
Fall 2020 log

## October 19

What I did:
- Watched the "What is a computer" related vids
- Signed up for GitHub
- Installed Atom
- Watched the Harvard video - dude had weird energy

Questions/ideas:
- Treat my own computer better.

## November 2

What I did:
- Worked on my GIS data. Approx. 10 hours.
- Worked on DS related arch resources
- Began a DS bibliography for archaeology

Questions/ideas:
- Workshop ideas following meeting.
- Command line? Command line...

Other updates:
- ASOR next week! Which means my paper won't be my time enemy for much longer.

## November 16

What I did:
- Participated in the archaeology workshop 'Best Practices for Digital Scholarship (Workshop)' at the annual American Schools for Oriental Studies meeting. Five panelists and many discussants addressing methods, best practices, ethics, and problems of mass data storage, collaboration, mass data dissemination, open source archaeological data, "in the field" problems like an increased reliance on digital tools in the field but where real-world factors like limited electricity and internet inhibit workflow.
- Finished cleaning my GIS data, producing a more robust framework for querying this data, and then digitized three archaeological surveys according to this new framework. Currently +750 archaeological sites mapped in QGIS. Re: cleaning - my attribute table was inconsistent, which meant that querying data and producing valuable analytics would have been incomplete. Approx 40 hours.
- "What is the internet related vids"
- Command line revisited
- Began DH for humanities tutorial
- Began AutoGIS tutorial
- Explored various options for working with python (within Atom, Anaconda, within QGIS itself)
- Installed packages in Atom: terminus, run-python-simply, build-python, build, atom-python-run, busy-signal,
- Downloaded Anaconda and watched tutorials about creating environments. Checked version installation using command line, but I think there is a problem. Several versions of Python installed and the one associated with Anaconda is not the one recognized through % python in command line (it should read Python 3.6 |Anaconda..., etc| but instead only Python 2.7.16 opens as default (which is a problem because I already thought I was using Python 3.8).
- Spent more time familiarizing myself with GitHub
- Thought about the page we will develop. Ideas: professional website (academic and art); open sourcing my own research GIS data and bibliography at end of dissertation; Open source QGIS project in progress.

Questions/ideas:
- Some new resources to add for archaeology based on the workshop I attended. The discipline of archaeology seems to have two major problems - 1) data management and storage; 2) sharing data related issues (legibility for collaborators, channels for mass data sharing, "in the field" practical problems).
- Question for myself: how can I foreshadow and address some of the issues discussed in this workshop and incorporate them into my own work before they become a future problem?
- How can I not overwhelm/fatigue myself, especially when my computer does not do things the way my tutorials say they will. It feels hopeless even with troubleshooting on stack, google, and GitHub!

Other updates:
- N/A

## November 30
- Met with Alice on Nov 20
- Watched two AutomateGIS tutorials, entry level Jupyter (looked at interface), ready to start python
- Added some info to existing html sandbox packages
- Watched a video about wireframe basics
- Draft Wireframe of actual professional page
- reviewed slides from previous Session
- html basics on w3schools
- Food coma from Nov 26-28.

- Wireframe:
- ![ZS_Wireframe](../media/ZSilvia-d8259fb4.jpg)

## December 14

What I did:
- Worked on professional website using an HTML5 Template
  - tried to upload to domain of one's own, but cannot get the page to display. Also a problem with one of the tabbed links.
- QGIS and Python: Learned how to access features and attributes within a layer using the Python Console. Learned how to find the coordinates of features within a layer. Entered these instructions in QGIS for Archaeologists document reflecting what was learned.
- Completed Lesson 1 in AutomatingQGIS class. Learned how to create points, lines, polygons, define a boundary, create shapes with holes in them all with shapely using Jupyter.
- Workshop ideas:
  - 1) QGIS for Archaeology, Classics, and HART students: An Introduction. Why GIS?
    - This session would be a very basic overview of GIS. What are its applications? How do people use it? And specifically, why is GIS an important tool for students in the humanities? What can archaeology, classics, and history of art students gain from learning GIS basics?
  - 2) QGIS: Creating your first map.
    - Raster vs. Vector maps. Working with historical maps vs. vector maps.
    - Coordinate systems, layers, attribute tables, points, and polygons.

Questions/ideas:
- None this week.
