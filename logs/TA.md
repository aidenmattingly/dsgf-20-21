## January 21

What I did:
- I experimented and worked with Voyant Tools
- I did some more research on Distant Reading
- For this research, I read Franco Moretti's articles "the Slaughterhouse of Literature" and "Conjectures on World Literature." I also read Kathryn Schulz's NY times article "The Mechanic Muse,What is Distant Reading"
- I wrote a short description for my workshop and proposed a date and time.


Questions/ideas:
- For our workshops, is it ok to suggest people read an article before they attend?
