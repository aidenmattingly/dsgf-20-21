## January 21

What I did:
- I experimented and worked with Voyant Tools
- I did some more research on Distant Reading
- For this research, I read Franco Moretti's articles "the Slaughterhouse of Literature" and "Conjectures on World Literature." I also read Kathryn Schulz's NY times article "The Mechanic Muse,What is Distant Reading"
- I wrote a short description for my workshop and proposed a date and time.


Questions/ideas:
- For our workshops, is it ok to suggest people read an article before they attend?



## January 26

What I did:
- I went back and tried to calculate how much hours I actually put in for the two workshops for this pay period.
- I explored the Canva website, and created a sample poster for our Graduate Showcase.

- I tried to get a head start on our DHRI Git tutorial.



Questions/ideas:
- Do you think people are likely to attend a workshop if it is earlier or latter in the day?
