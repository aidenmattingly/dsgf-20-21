# My Name
Fall 2020 log

## December 16

What I did:
- I read through the Web Accessibility slides and the Domain of One's Own Workshop Slides
- I also read through the Tech docs for Domain of One's Own Resources
- I continued working on my personal website
- I also worked on my workshop ideas.

Questions/ideas:
- I realize that I don't really know how to create a professional looking website. Now that I have learned about web publishing, and publishing my own website, I am not sure what my website should have, or what it should look like. It would be very helpful for me if there were some resource with tips on how to make a personal website look professional: i.e what should website look like, what information should it have, what sort of pictures I should put on there.
