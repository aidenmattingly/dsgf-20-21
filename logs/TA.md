Spring 2021 log

## January 26

What I did:
- I went back and tried to calculate how much hours I actually put in for the two workshops for this pay period.
- I explored the Canva website, and created a sample poster for our Graduate Showcase.
- I tried to get a head start on our DHRI Git tutorial.



Questions/ideas:
- Does anybody have any opinions on how early or late the workshops should be? Do you think people will attend if the workshops are earlier in the day, or later?
