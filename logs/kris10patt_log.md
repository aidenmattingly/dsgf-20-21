Fall 2020 log

## December 14

What I did:
- worked on personal website using a html5 template
- uploaded site to my domain and took down the old site (but I still have the files) (kpatterson.digital.brynmawr.edu/my-site-story/#)
- started working through the accessibility issues.

Questions/ideas:
- how do we create a website with multiple pages? I think I have a basic idea of how to do it, i.e. create more html pages and link them together, but I wouldn't mind a demo.
- When I was experimenting with my site, my browser gave me some notifications that it was "not secure," especially in relation to the email box at the bottom. How can we make our sites more secure?

Other updates:
- Attended the AIMS conference. Learned about the Antiquitropes project by Jaclyn Neel. Possibly the digital humanities group would be interested in this.
