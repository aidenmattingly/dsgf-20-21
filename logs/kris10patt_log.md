Fall 2020 log


## November 2

What I did:
- read dhq digital humanities article
- looked through some of the stoa blog (https://blog.stoa.org)

Questions/ideas:
- Can we practice more with using Github and Atom? I don't feel I've gotten the hang of it yet

## November 16

What I did:

- tried to create a virtual environment with python in order to get started with CLTK. Failed.
- Researched recommendations for academic personal websites

Questions/ideas:
- I really need to learn the basics of python

## December 14

What I did:
- worked on personal website using a html5 template
- uploaded site to my domain and took down the old site (but I still have the files) (kpatterson.digital.brynmawr.edu/my-site-story/#)
- started working through the accessibility issues.

Questions/ideas:
- how do we create a website with multiple pages? I think I have a basic idea of how to do it, i.e. create more html pages and link them together, but I wouldn't mind a demo.
- When I was experimenting with my site, my browser gave me some notifications that it was "not secure," especially in relation to the email box at the bottom. How can we make our sites more secure?

Other updates:
- Attended the AIMS conference. Learned about the Antiquitropes project by Jaclyn Neel. Possibly the digital humanities group would be interested in this.

## January 22

What I did:
- progressed with the cltk, working through this tutorial [link](https://github.com/cltk/tutorials)
- discovered the wonders and joys of working in Jupyter notebooks.
- plotted for lightning talks and workshops.

Questions/ideas:
- I ran into some trouble trying to use command line arguments in Jupyter notebooks. pwd, ls, and cd all seem to work, but I tried to cat a txt file and got a syntax error that I could not resolve.

## February 9

what I did:
- worked more with cltk 
- looked at some more html5 up sites to choose one for the workshop
- started working throught the linkedin learning course for html bootstrap

Questions/Ideas:
- I'm leaning towards useing the "Massively" template for the workshop [massively demo](https://html5up.net/massively). I'm still open to feedback, though.
